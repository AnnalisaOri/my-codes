# Annalisa Ori   

## Introduction  
I am Annalisa Ori, 23 years old, and I have been fascinated by numbers and by how reality can be explained through them since I was a child.
Driven by this interest, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Statistical and Economic Sciences. My academic path has allowed me to develop a solid understanding of fundamental theories as well as their practical applications.
I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and analytical skills. On this channel, I share my personal projects developed during my years of study.

## Projects 

### Binomial Option Pricing Model: From Discrete Time to Black-Scholes
This repository presents a comprehensive, computational analysis of the Binomial Option Pricing Model (BOPM)—the essential discrete-time framework for derivatives valuation. Implemented using Python simulations in a Jupyter Notebook, this project bridges fundamental theoretical concepts with practical quantitative finance.

**Key Focus Areas and Computational Demonstrations:** The code starts by modeling a simplified two-period market and gradually generalizes the framework to multiple time steps, offering a transparent view of core financial principles:

**No-Arbitrage Principle**: We demonstrate the fundamental condition under which a market is free from riskless profit opportunities.

**Market Completeness and Replication:** The project illustrates how a derivative's payoff can be perfectly replicated by a dynamic portfolio of the underlying stock and a risk-free bond, which ensures market completeness and unique asset pricing.

**Convergence to Black-Scholes:** By increasing the number of time steps, the Python implementation clearly showcases the celebrated limit of the binomial model—its numerical convergence to the continuous-time Black-Scholes-Merton formula.

### Analysis of a Time Series: ROAD TRAFFIC TRENDS IN MINNESOTA

**Description:** The aim of this project is to analyze road traffic in Minnesota, USA, in relation to various factors such as weather conditions, temperature, and holidays/weekends. Initially, I conducted an exploratory analysis of the time series, checking for normality, stationarity, and the presence of trends and seasonality. Subsequently, I developed several models, including simple linear regression, ARIMA, SARIMA, and regARIMA. Finally, I selected the best model and used it to forecast traffic trends.

### Analysis of Two State-Space Models: Kalman Filter and Smoother

**Description 1:** Analysis and Estimation of State-Space Models Applied to the Annual Flow Series of the Nile River, Using the R Package KFAS.
Includes estimation via maximum likelihood, Kalman filtering and smoothing, and structural change analysis using step variables.

**R Code and analysis:** [Quart document, pdf](https://github.com/AnnalisaOri/Progetti/blob/main/StateSpaceModels.pdf)

**Description 2:** Estimation of a State-Space Model for the Monthly Sunspot Time Series, Incorporating an Integrated Random Walk, a Seasonal Component with Stochastic Dummies, and a Persistent Stochastic Cycle.
Detailed plots of latent components are produced, and long-term forecasts with confidence intervals are generated.

### Excel Project - For the Insurance Economics exam

**Description:** The Excel file is organized to follow the different topics of the course:
1. **Non-Life Insurance**
   - **Claims reserving – Chain-Ladder method**: based on a Run-Off triangle of paid claims.
   - **Separation method**: the reserve is recalculated by separating frequency (number of claims) from severity (average claim amount).  
   - **Technical account for P&C**: using financial statement data (premiums, reserves, paid claims, expenses) to calculate earned premiums and claims, final reserves, loss ratio, expense ratio, and combined ratio. 


2. **Life Insurance**  
   - **Unit Linked**: calculation of premium loadings, allocation across funds, and determination of the minimum fund share so that the payable capital in case of a claim exceeds the minimum guarantee.
   - **Revaluable mixed insurance**: calculation of the annual pure premium (highlighting risk and savings components), mathematical reserves, and capital revaluation (with constant or revaluable premium) based on the returns of the separate account. 
   - **Cliquet and Best-Of revaluation**: comparison of the two capital revaluation mechanisms under a guaranteed minimum rate and variable returns.

###  Bachelor’s Thesis: Dynamics of Predation and Competition Models

**Description:** Modeled the dynamics of three populations using systems of ordinary differential equations, analyzed their evolution with mathematical tools for qualitative study of differential models, and visualized the results through numerical simulations in MATLAB.

### SIRS MODEL

**Description:**  The spread of certain pandemics, such as COVID-19, can be modeled—under simplifying assumptions—using a variant of the classical SIR model. Unlike the SIR model, the SIRS model accounts for the possibility that individuals may lose immunity over time and become susceptible to infection again. Using the theory of dynamical system stability, I studied the temporal evolution of the system.
